            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <h3>The standard way to write about page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm born in 2009.04.11 and as of today I'm a homeschooled Junior. I came from Shanghai, China.</li>
                    <li>My primary interest lies in physics and I'm currently grinding for (hopefully) IPhO. I also have deep interests in Math, CS, Astronomy, Chemistry, etc.</li>
                    <li>Outside of academics, I can be found drawing OCs, journaling, calling my friend, playing badminton, cooking, playing piano, coding, playing among us, finding new decluttering tools, losing my mind due to PMDD, etc.</li>
                    <li>By the way, my family is (kinda) poor judging by U.S. standards, so I would mostly prefer to study and do digital work because, well, they're cheaper.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>A more Physics Olympiad flavored way</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physics was my least favorite subject in G8, just like how Biology was in G7, Chemistry was in G9, Math was until G10.</li>
                    <li>I'm currently homeschooled and it's the best choice I've ever made in my life.</li>
                    <li>Another reason for me to be willing to camp and IPhO is that I feel so lonely as a physics student, I literally know zero (future or not) physics majors in real life, and I don't know anyone online that well. To be fair, part of it was due to my introverted nature.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>A descriptive way</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a huge minimalist and try my best to replace everything I own into a black and white version.</li>
                    <li>I'm extremely bad at communicating face to face. When I really want to say something important, I will usually write it down.</li>
                    <li>For some reason, I overweight certain words. For example, "friend" in my dictionary most likely meant "best friends forever" in yours.</li>
                    <li>I used to have BPD and social phobia, which have been treated bit by bit after homeschooling. I will probably have C-PTSD until I made IPhO.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><a href="tests.html">Some personality test results</a></h3>
                <p>Disclaimer: I don't take personality tests too seriously, but they're fun.</p>

            <h2>Now</h2>
            <p>What I'm up to.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PhO. I finished the core curriculum of Knzhou handouts and smashed my head into the additional handouts. I'll risk whatever I have to camp this year and hopefully to also make IPhO (I know I "shouldn't be" a head on a stick, but making IPhO is important for my personal development in a weird way that nobody would've guessed).</li>
                <li>Web development. I'm learning on freeCodeCamp and integrate whatever I've learned into building this site which is why I started to learn developing in first place. Currently on CSS and soon I'll get into JavaScript. </li>
                <li>Swift and SwiftUI. It's the fallback when I don't have energy to do other things.</li>
                <li>Astro Olympiad. I don't know exactly why but stars and AO guides are both beautiful. Again, the "O" part is an excuse for learning things that doesn't have "immediate use".</li>
                <li>MIT 18.03. I am stuck at an integral in PS5 P21. I felt like I've been learning slower and slower with the math part due to learning all these things above and I need to find a way to accelerate it back.</li>
                <li>MIT applications. I have to finish humanities recommendation letter, varsity sports questionare and portfolios. I'll do essays and portfolios till the very end since I'm rapidly improving. I'm almost sure I will not accept the offer even if I got in this year (because I need a LOT of time to work on my creations and learn other things, also I can't be sure about IPhO yet), but I consider it a good chance for practicing and to settle my mind.</li>
                <li>I have one WIP drawing of my OC and n WIP writings for this site and fanfics respctively. </li>
                <li>This website.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="about" id="vision">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <h3>Academics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I hope to discover which area of physics do I like the most. I am grasping a small sense of what physics research feels like.</li>
                    <li>Outside of physics, I also want to learn a lot of math and AI, hopefully also chemistry, biology, etc. I'm extremely unsure of what learning them feels like, but we'll see.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Creations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I hope to learn more about coding and be able to make bigger projects.</li>
                    <li>I want to be able to make a fantastic MV all by myself, which means I want to learn composing, post-producting, frame by frame animation, whatever softwares I need, and practice more drawing & skeletal animation.</li>
                    <li>Unrealistically speaking, I'm just greedy and want to try almost all digital creating medias imaginable to human, which means game development, 3d modeling/rendering/whatever and novel writing etc. are also in the list. I'm sure the majority of workface masters one or two of the said skills and I doubt whether I can learn so much when life's just getting busier and busier, but we'll find out.</li>
                    <li>I also want to learn clothes designing and sewing and all that. I feel like I always want to specify the texture of my OC's clothes as accuratly as possible, and I also want to try make some pro max plus custom clothes for myself. (By the way, OC=Original Character)</li>
                    <li>Speaking of designing, I also want to be able to do simple mechanic and electric engineering. I just want to design.  Although everything non-digital is going to cost lots of money, that's why they come last for me.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>Personal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to repair broken relationships instead of leaving the ruins there and move on without knowing what happens afterwards. I live well without doing so (and even with a sense of forgetting about the past), yet this will definetly go into my before-death wishlist. I'm sorry for what I've done and for hurting others. Mostly a past friend. </li>
                    <li>I also want to continue to be good friends with FrozenMoon24V. My current mind is stable enough to stop me from starting a quarrel with anyone and that we have some of the most healthy friendship I'm ever aware of, but I still can't be too sure about it. My ability and vision is improving so rapidly that I fear I'll meet more great people and our friendship might fade in turn, but I have faith because our friendship is rooted within some of our deepest and most treasured things. <br> I sincerely hope we can really reach that future of becoming slightly famous as creators and promote each other and even be friends lifelong. I was imagining for quite long that, if the plane is going to crash, the first thing I'll do is to send my account passwords to him.</li>
                    <li>I have no idea what the future might be like, so I don't really have much goals on personal development.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>For fun</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to memorize the periodic table. Felt like this is more challenging & useful & fun than memorizing pi.</li>
                </ul>
