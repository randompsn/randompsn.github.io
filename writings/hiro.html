        <h1>I Dislike How Shinosawa Hiro Was Potrayed And Who Cares</h1>
            <p>Before we begin, here're some contexts. Shinosawa Hiro (篠澤 広) is a playable character in Gakuen Idolmaster (学園アイドルマスター) and one of the most popular characters. Honestly speaking, I follow along most of the MVs posted and sometimes listens to songs, nothing else —— I was interested in GakuMas in the first place because of their 3D live rendering is the best I've seen in moblie idol games, and then got hooked by the MVs (yes I really like MVs and who doesn't).</p>
            <p>This is extremely personal and I found it childish. I would say I didn't cared about Hiro nor any community I mentioned here if it's impersonal, but here we are.</p>
            <p>I like Hiro aesthetically, yet I completely cannot get her motivation. Based on her character description of being skilled at “math, physics, any studies” and have already graduated from college, I imagine she double majored math and physics and earned BS degrees for them at the age of 14. So, is graduate, PhD and research programs after that not hard enough for her that she must come to an idol prep school to finally find some challenge? I don't even bother to say, but the writer(s) is probably so obsessed with her setting of being “physically weak yet masochistic” and “wanted to get scolded by producer because always being the genius is boring”, not to mention I haven't seen a single place where she has shown wisdom that matches with her achievement, outside of plain test scores. I just felt extremely regretful at this point because she could've been a lot more interesting with such a setting. Well, I really shouldn't have expectations for idol games.</p>
