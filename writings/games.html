<h1>Games I've played</h1>
    <h2>Playing but low commitment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse:1999</li>
        <li>Arknights</li>
        <li>Phigros</li>
        <li>Among Us!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Played</h2>
    <p>I can't play the bad endings myself. I don't get that emotionally attached but it's quite unbearable for me to be mean to game characters. If I want to see CG and plot I'll just search online, I couldn't care less about achievements if I must say something like "Lilith I hate your name please go die" to obtain them. Ok maybe I really got emotionally attached but it's really unbearable to be mean to them because of my PTSD.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Undertale (Peace route only)</li>
        <li>The Henry Stickmin Collection</li>
        <li>Saihate Station (True end only)</li>
        <li>Monument Valley</li>
        <li>The Birdcage (did not play the paid content in 2 and 3)</li>
        <li>The Alterhistorian's Conquest</li>
        <li>Particle Clicker (didn't finish)</li>
        <li>Velocity Raptor</li>
        <li>The NOexistenceN of you AND me (Good ending & achievements not exclusive to negative options only)</li>
        <li>Do You Really Want To Know (1&2, for 1 get home end and J.C. end only, for 2 周川成 end only. I'm not good at using the save button and it's tedious to play the game multiple times without being able to skip...)</li>
        <li>Until Then (I didn't go for all achievements but I did get the karaoke achievement on the third try. Additional warning: recommended to play without physics background.)</li>

My account by that time was like Anniewang8 with password Green9 and the name Skylar Rainsword (I didn't know how to find a name). Things have changed really much.</li>
