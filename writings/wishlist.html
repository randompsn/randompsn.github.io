        <h1>Before-Death Wishlist</h1>
        <p>*To clarify, these aren't things that I must finish in order to die, but it's good to have tried them when I can. I just realized this is highly overlapping with visions, but it's still worth putting down.</p>

            <li>Put everything I wanted to say but didn't onto my personal website <span lang="cn">（：想写一篇那种写的时候感觉像是一点一点抠挖着心脏和脑，如同野兽觅食一样粗暴地啮咬开血管扯出来，用爪牙抓挠剩下的冒着鲜血的肉块凝结成文字的东西，神魂被掏空后附着到符号暧昧不清的意义里，此后想写的无论是诗还是博客之类的事物都因为体内空乏无一物而难以下笔，像是变成一具徒有外壳的空心人。。）</span></li>
            <li>Learn some social sciences and humanities by interest, e.g. Semiotics, Dramaturgy and Sociology.</li>

            <li>Dig in my old accounts. I was a maniac and deleted all those "dangerous" things though, so I doubt whether there's much for me to find.</li>
