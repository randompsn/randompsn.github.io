        <h1>Names</h1>
        <p>I don't care much about names. I'm bad at remembering names, most of my OCs don't have a name, and I myself change usernames quite oftenly. Here's a collection of my names. Warning: mass using of &lt;ruby&gt; elements.</p>
        <h2>Most used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Annie Wang, <ruby>王<rt>Wang2</rt>紫<rt>Zi3</rt>怡<rt>Yi2</rt></ruby>. These are my legal names.</li>
                <li><ruby>星<rt>Xing1</rt>夜<rt>Ye4</rt></ruby>, XingYe23z, Starry Sky. This is my most used name from G4-9, with the second and third being username and english versions respectively, and the first being short for the full name version "<ruby>星<rt>Xing1</rt>夜<rt>Ye4</rt>之<rt>Zhi1</rt>梦<rt>Meng4</rt></ruby>"(with the literal meaning "Starry Night's Dream") which was abandoned with time since I was most referred to as the short version. I don't use this name anymore though a lot still call me this. Variants include <ruby>星<rt>Xing1</rt>夜<rt>Ye4</rt>酱<rt>Jiang4</rt></ruby> which adds the homophonic to the Japanese suffix ちゃん(chan) and <ruby>千<rt>ち</rt>空<rt>そら</rt>星<rt>ほし</rt>夜<rt>よる</rt></ruby>(Chisora Hoshiyoru) which is intended to act as a Japanese fullname (By the way, I prefer the pronounciation <ruby>星<rt>せい</rt>夜<rt>や</rt></ruby>(Seiya) in all other scenarios). And exclusively, I refer to myself while still using the name as よる(Yoru).</li>
                <li>Randompsn, ランダム(Randamu), 무작위의(mujagwiui). A name that emerged from G10 fall when I realized I should probably not use real name in discord (I was doing so to find peers from the same school). Notice that the "psn" part, short for person like how ppl is short for people, is omitted in japanese and korean versions. A literal unused Chinese translation is "<ruby>随<rt>Sui2</rt>机<rt>Ji1</rt>人<rt>Ren2</rt></ruby>".</li>
                <li>YuruYoru, ゆるよる(Yuruyoru), 유루요루(Yuruyoru). The "yoru" part came from the japanese of "night". I use this name mainly to escape from my best friend's stalking. </li>
                <li>Wanny, <ruby>王<rt>Wang2</rt>安<rt>An1</rt>妮<rt>Ni2</rt></ruby>. The former is short for "Wang Annie" while the latter is the Chinese homophonic, both are my most called nicknames during middle school. According to my parents, the latter really was almost going to be my legal Chinese name but they changed their mind.</li>
                <li>Why I, among us name. When ejected it displays "Why I was (not) An Impostor" or "Why I was ejected". By the way, my standard appearance is this name with a full banana suit but the color yellow.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Others</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><ruby>普<rt>Pu3</rt>通<rt>Tong1</rt>中<rt>Zhong1</rt>学<rt>Xue2</rt>的<rt>De5</rt>物<rt>Wu4</rt>理<rt>Li3</rt>实<rt>Shi2</rt>验<rt>Yan4</rt>室<rt>Shi4</rt></ruby>, lofter nickname, with the literal meaning "Physics Lab of an ordinary Middle School" in parallel to the opening "<ruby>这<rt>Zhe4</rt>是<rt>Shi4</rt>普<rt>Pu3</rt>通<rt>Tong1</rt>中<rt>Zhong1</rt>学<rt>Xue2</rt>的<rt>De5</rt>化<rt>Hua4</rt>学<rt>Xue2</rt>实<rt>Shi2</rt>验<rt>Yan4</rt>室<rt>Shi4</rt></ruby>" (This is a chemistry lab of an ordinary middle school) in widely used Chinese chemistry lab videos. Changed "chemistry" to "physics" because I'm more of a physics student and that I ship physics and chemistry.</li>
                <li><ruby>沐<rt>Mu4</rt>风<rt>Feng1</rt></ruby>, with the literal meaning "Bathing in breeze". I used it during G4-6 as my name for the game Tom & Jerry and associated community.</li>
            </ul>
