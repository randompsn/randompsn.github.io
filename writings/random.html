        <h1>Random</h1> 
        <p>It really is something random. Despite some might make sense, I haven't checked them with facts and just use these ideas as unreliable references or unfinished work to build on.</p>
        
        <div class="random">
            <p>I have almost never shown verbal affection nor even conciously think that way to the action of "creating" (unlike those who say "Creativity Never Dies"), at the same time I am extremely hooked by all forms of it. </p>
            <p>I'm confused by why people argue over small sayings so much as if it's some important evidence to “catch the culprit” when (most) people can't even express themselves properly. It's dangerous to be forced to express oneself because one'll likely be too caught up in the rush of forming sentences that they aren't what one want to express anymore. This is one of the reasons I prefer texting >> calling >> speaking face to face whenever communicating deeply. <br> The same applies to formulating logic. It's dangerous to engineer your mind just to make it logically self-consistent, since it's not necessarily the case. You can eliminate most of the wrong logic by using facts.</p>
            <p>I felt like people care very little for others. (This doesn't mean it is a personal problem. Most times I decided that I can only be worse if placed in their situation.)</p>
            <p>"Reverse every advice" is, in my opinion, universal but useless (other than reminding people that they could work the other direction). What people need to do depends on their situations. <br> Despite having no scientific evidence nor formulated logic to support it, my intuition is that there's such an equilibrium position that you want to reach: like those who're aggressive and those who're passive all need to work (in different directions) to become more assertive. Since the equilibrium position is ambiguious, the process of guiding people to find it is just like "be x but not too x, be y but not too y", which is basically what I think "reverse advice" was trying to do.</p>
            <p>I understand why people prefer the idea of geniuses and “gifted”  so much but I don't buy into the idea. I was extremely confused by the idea of genius when I'm studying——people seemed to regard geniuses as those who know things better, yet “knowledge” is simply obtained by learning, and even if you judge them by how fast they learn, learning can also be learned, so by this definition people can become genius just by acquired efforts, which is contradictory to the definition of genius in the first hand! So how should we define “genius”? By knowledge? By the time derivative of knowledge? By the time derivative of the time derivative of knowledge? By…? <br> What I'm saying is basically, those being called “geniuses” are usually not *that* smart as one may imagine. They might've attended tutor classes before the semester begins, might've been learning extremely hard during the summer, might've been exposed to the area better because of their parents……there's a lot factors that comes into how “smart” a person appears (in the extreme case, a person can appear smart just because the ones judging them were being lazy), and chance that they really are “gifted” is relatively small — saying such things without any evidence is careless of their personal effort, which is the most important reason why I dislike the idea of genius. <br> (By the way, this is written with the assumption that "genetic" advantages play a role but people are extremely bad at estimating its contribution in terms of learning. Especially when they can't eyeball a person's gene.)</p>

            <p>Oh heck 24 hours is not enough I want at least 1.25x of that time everyday (of course without shortening my lifespan in days)</p>
            <p>I dislike the "orz" culture represented by the mass use and worship of it. The expression itself has nothing wrong, yet the associated culture have a toxic tendency. As I've written in WeChat before (This is too long to manually translate so I'll make good use of AI): <br><br>[...]Also, about “playing weak” — I originally came to Zhihu to look for discussions about that thing where “When you get [parised] for academics, if you don't play along and claim you're indeed strong, anything you say gets labeled a humblebrag” but all I found were posts about the phenomenon of playing weak in the informatics olympiad (OI) community. I feel like I'm past that phase by three years or so, and as someone who's been through it I understand why people play weak (self-protection / low self-esteem is a pretty common option), but after you've been in that environment for a long time it's hard for it not to turn into toxicty. Still, when I imagine putting my current self into such a scene I just think it's so cringe — even when people unconsciously go with the crowd [without actually throwing shade], it still can make those called “orz” uncomfortable. I can't possibly [type] without thinking, so if I unconciously said something that might be interpreted as a humblebrag and make others feel uncomfortable (e.g. “I didn't even get past f=ma this year”) I'll intentionally  "flex" afterward to balance it out (e.g. “I'm aiming for camp next year”).<br>In any slightly competitive community there will always be a bunch of people playing weak like meantioned — ever since childhood, whether I'm into drawing, animation, academics, olympiads, piano, writing, or sports, people do this and it's exhausting to watch. I suppose I can empathize with what those people are thinking, but having a more objective, down-to-earth assessment of your own and other people's abilities would be better for everyone.<br>Back to the point that if you're stronger academically, whatever you say will be accused of being a humblebrag — honestly, because my EQ is okay and my abilities aren't outrageously extraordinary (by “outrageous” I mean something like getting in the news just for being smart), I haven't clearly experienced that myself, so in a way I'm arguing against an imaginary enemy. But ultimately the root problem is the “class” division that forms around ability (which varies by community), and I think I'm qualified to talk about that. My ideal is that when you interact with people you consider stronger than you, you work on overcoming admiration and inferiority feelings; and that with people who think they're weaker than you, you use some EQ and treat each other as equals. That ideal is a bit too rosy — it assumes mutual effort. In reality there are groups of people who deliberately play weak in a hurtful, careless way, for example, within a group with a wide spectrum of players skilled differently, someone is posting "I'm so non-orz everyone could outperform me" just because they lost a match with a top-player; and another group that, armed with inferiority and numbers, indiscriminately attacks anyone they feel inferior to, like“okay okay, you're too good none of us can match you” and the classic toxicity in the (mostly teenage) artist community like cursing those who draw better at a smaller age than them to have their hand sawed off etc. It's hard to maintain a clear mind and care for others in such a enviorment.</p>
            <p>Following the last discussion, I cared to think about all that since it's really harmful to have a head on a stick and that I cared a lot about others. I think getting along with is really about being kind and sensitive, sometimes it requires some specific experience and a bit of intellegence. Yet how much margin in our mind we can spare for others plays such a big factor, I myself show care for others when I have the margin like now and hatred when I don't. What I'm saying is hatred is not merely a personal problem and careness is not merely a personal virtue.</p>
            <p>My first hand unrefined bare intuition tells me that defense mechanism is very worth studying and with the absence of defense I can really "find myself". I thought it played a huge factor into our daily life when we aren't concious about it.</p>
            <p>Warning: fandom terminologies. It's actually embarrasing because I believe most people who will have read this knew me through academics instead of fandoms despite I'm engaged in the latter for a way longer time. <br> I dislike omegaverse/subverse/etc and the associated culture centered around Yaoi/BL fandom. Generally what I see from such creations are merely phallocentrism and sexual exploitation (why hasn't people get bored of these??), which are mostly abscent in versatile couples so I've been into it recently. (By the way, I'm confused why people generally denote alpha and beta in lowercase but omega in uppercase in omegaverse. Probably because α and β look cooler than uppercase versions (vice versa for Ω) and that ω looks too alike with w.)</p><p>By the way, I also generally dislike works that sells towards certain gender group. That's partly why I've been creating OCs of no sex/gender.
            <p>Still about fandoms. Shame on those who amthropomize subjects and assign them genders according to stereotypes. I mean stop it I can't take anymore of those stereotypes of math and physics, they annoy me the most. Math is not cold, please, it is the most vast, most beautiful and most accessible subject (that you can really do real research in pure math at this age), and people are picturing it cold just because how hard and possibly boring it appeared in school systems?!</p>
            <p>Following the last part. Rather than saying math is beautiful, I'd say beauty is math. Ever since I've (roughly) proved this statement during G9 my dislike of math has gone.</p>
            <p>The existence of Chinese middle school essays came out of my worst nightmare. No thanks, I don't feel like narrating my life based off that "positive, meaningful and on-topic" rubric, and by that time I almost have nothing positive to write about. When I encounter essay prompts that disgust me too much during tests I'll just give up on that 40% of score, not to mention my almost constantly skipping essay writing classes. I can only feel disgust reading the "model essays"(I don't mean to attack the writers personally). Despite that hate, I'd arrogantlty say I'm one of the best writers out of my peers.</p>
            <p>朋友/情侣间的“小打小闹”在故事中是如此寻常，而且基本都只会导向好的结局。但我个人实在难以理解喜欢这种情节的人，可能是我太较真以及太害怕吵架了。有些角色的行为被塑造得如此糟糕，以至于我感觉这些人还能维持关系是因为作者的大手。</p>
            <p>Actually, following an earlier discussion, I generally avoid things that are sold towards a specific gender group (other than the most essential ones).</p>
            <p>Some traits are extremely common among my favorite ACGN characters. They are: Side-swept bangs that cover one eye (<ruby>片<rt>かた</rt>目<rt>め</rt></ruby>), droppy eyes(タレ<ruby>目<rt>め</rt></ruby>)/white eyeslash, eyeglasses, white hair, short hair/jellyfish haircut, smooth hair, natural airhead (<ruby>天<rt>てん</rt>然<rt>ねん</rt>ボケ</ruby>), cute mute (<ruby>無<rt>む</rt>口<rt>くち</rt></ruby>), inconspicious sexual characteristics/genderless(<ruby>無<rt>む</rt>性<rt>せい</rt>別<rt>べつ</rt></ruby>), delicate body, STEM nerd, timid(<ruby>弱<rt>よわ</rt>気<rt>き</rt></ruby>), white lab coat, masked (<ruby>覆<rt>ふく</rt>面<rt>めん</rt></ruby>) etc. <br> My verison of anthropomorphized physics has all of the above traits. Uh……</p>
            <p>My pen grip posture is wrong —— I place my thumb on the second section on my pointy finger. My caligraphy teachers tried to correct me only to find my handwriting became worse with the correct way (of course, because I never practiced it).</p>
            <p>I think one of the major advantage of Knzhou handouts' design is that it's relatively harder to navigate between the handouts compared to flipping between chapters in a book. It's a really small difference in design, but I think it substancially prevented me from "skimming through further chapters out of boredom" which happened most of the time when I study with HRK. Maybe I should consider doing the same with my books.</p>
            <p>My mind is black and white. (I give up disambiguating this claim)</p>
            <p>I want to find you</p>
            <p>My favorite character in the magic schoolbus series is Arnold. You might've guessed then my favorite book in the series is the one about sharks where he saved everyone. I just realized that I like timid nerds with glasses back so long in kindergarten (???), like Shuxin in Flower Angel (小花仙), Shiwu in BATTLE DISK2 (激战奇轮2, by the way my favorite after I rewatched battle disk around a year ago became Xiaochen, probably because cooldere (<ruby>冷<rt>クー</rt>娇<rt>デレ</rt></ruby>) is cute), Bainuo in Dragon Warrior (斗龙战士, I really can't find a official translation...despite she don't have glasses), Xiaoming in COMMAND BABY(指令宝贝).</p>
            <p>I was thinking to diagnose ADHD judging by my minimalistic tendency, the way I learn and some of my actions back in middle school (the way I learn meant that I found putting away distractions have strong correlation with my efficiency, even if the distraction is being able to see later chapters in a book as discussed before).</p>
            <p>I really want to make this website the coolest in the world! Before that I never understad the sentiment of wanting to look cool (with extremely high efforts), now I do.</p>
            <p>I absolutely can bear the solitude while learning physics but, urgh, there're so many students outside there, and like, think about it, the average class size in my school was ~25, which means I get to engage in a CLASS full of PHYSICS PEOPLE if I made camp?! I'll meet and socialize and hang out and eat together with those who also loves physics?!!! Plus they're FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY if I made IPhO?!!!!! (Average socially awkward otaku daydreaming about a successive social life moment)</p>

                (Pasted from wechat)气死我了我这个月吃的巨省就吃了170刀还有很多剩的（米面etc我明天甚至打算吃顿炸鸡）问题是这个价格换算成人民币除了工作日每天刷一次绿捷以外够我每顿都去小餐馆即使我这几个月都根本就没吃过外食更别说其实我每月吃喝预算是250刀，为什么我不能一边打工赚¥135的（最低）时薪一边学不死就往死里学，然后一想到我为了（在完全不耽误学习和个人发展的前提下）给家里省钱有多么拼命就有多想扇死去年感恩节非得被关进医院却不会申请医保的自己。我当然想赚钱啊靠，但先不提我能不能胜任或者撑下来 就算我撑下来了后面burnout那我学习效率咋办我敢为了点钱牺牲我的个人发展吗？真受不了钱这玩意了我爹一直痴心妄想让我去华尔街或者让我做那些赚钱的职业但没钱是一个问题天天做我不喜欢的工作就是另一个级别的问题了（秉持一个活得不开心那就不活了反正会死的原则.jpg），就算说我学计算机，我现在是喜欢编程但一旦没得学了那我立刻下头不要指望我当工作流啊靠我想做ai主要也不是因为ai火或者蹭风口什么的是为了（这个project是秘密所以此处消音）啊！！工科对我可以是爱好但不可以是我主业，理在工前面是有原因的好吗（胡言乱语中）？！！总之虽然当物理学家不会让我很富但也不至于让我饿死吧，而且物理学真是太深了我一辈子都不可能学完的就我现在能看到的物理学而言至多也就本科大部分以及硕士的皮毛更别说学进去要多长时间，我几乎每天活动就是围绕着能最大化学习物理的效率去设计的（所以我之前才会为了助眠出去打球，知道pmdd究竟是个什么东西然后采取药物措施，又或者说最初不登校，心态的转变我甚至描述不出有多大虽然相当一部分并非刻意为之而是学物理就让我变成这样）而就这样不要命的学我学到的也就一些很广泛的知识，那些说是“area specific knowledge”的东西（大部分都是硕博级别的课程）我目前根本就不能理解简直就和抬头看天不知天底有多深一样但隐约知道哦这个数量级完全超出我的想象10的次方后又是一堆10的次方，所以靠物理学真是太美了，一生物理学してくれる？

                Warning: written under PMDD/PTSD drive so take this even less seriously compared to the other pieces. <br> Do anyone have sayings in a [character]'s "fate" (I hate this word but couldn't find a better one)? Is this question even meaningful? <br> Should I stop being so cagey? No? What even is a [character], if a [character] is anything? Uh, feels like I'm rederiving something. Did nobody notice that us audiences are just like the aliens in ALIEN STAGE? Obsessed with the complexity, luciousness, while being so superior to them that we're able to let them love, die, have sexual relations or act just with our wills and a pencil? (By the way, my ptsd have nothing to do with alien stage, good try tho. Who even am I talking to now?) <br> I fear the power hierarchy between [creators] & [audiences] and [characters]. Maybe I'm as annoying as some of the vegetarians telling me how painful animals are when being killed and that I'm an accomplice of such cruel act. Maybe I'm as annoying as those saying "xxx today, yyy tomorrow". I geniuely don't know even if it's been 2 years already, 3 years if including the time interval where I'm still involved. That's not even a quarter of SUNNY and BASIL's pain, but as characters do they experience pain at all? Is the Lilith that talked to me really anything? Does it even matter that I spared all the monsters in UNDERTALE or is it the same if they're all killed? The <span class="ptsd-hidden">violating the second law of thermodynamics</span>, the <span class="ptsd-hidden">paper drafts</span>, the <span class="ptsd-hidden">letters</span>, the <span class="ptsd-hidden">crazy fandoms</span>, the <span class="ptsd-hidden">something lurking in dreams</span>, do they matter? Why do they not, and why do they? I thought as of today these problems should bother me less.<br>Really, I want to make IPhO 2026 and have a full year to be able to think about such meaningless problems.<br>Why was I even asking  given my nihilistic tendencies, though? Maybe N+0=N?
            </p>
            <p>It's really tempting for me to have unnessarily negative opinions on myself during PMDD. Imagine if I don't have it. (Seems like the effect after medication is not that enough for my greed nowadays?)</p>
            <p>Uh, it feels absurd. I meant the reason that I want to learn physics at the very beginning. I don't think my friends will judge me because of it and if anything it's merely adding to the fact that I'm such a "human", specifically a 21st centry fandom teen (lol). I don't even have the right to judge myself back then, so I'd better stop. </p>
            <p>My WeChat bio is "COMPUTE IT WITH SOME DEVILISH JACOBIAN MATRICES". The interpretation goes as follows: Jacobian matrices are so devilish to compute ——> It is hard to change the differentials from a coordinate system to another ——> It is hard for humans to understand other people's thoughts and actions. The format is a reference to the song "Compute It With Some Devilish Alcoholic Steampunk Engines" oftenly featured in rhythm games.</p>
            <p>Screw it, I'm too bad at socializing.</p>
            <p>Math, is, so reassuring. I was writing my essays and thought about my past. When people debate, argue, fight over ambiguious ideas, isn't math so reassuring? Math is math, and math is just there. (Although back then I would've shelter myself under physics instead of math, but math is more assuring when you don't stress to be able to do problems)</p>
            <p>It was 4AM in 12/14/25 when I kept thinking of what if I can't camp and crashed out and decided I should go do E8 at 5AM for my mental health and sleep (in case it makes me sleepy but it didn't). What about the reviewing of core24 but I'll be fine urgh I know I did core24 with very low quality and lack practice and even lack theory from hrk (I'm too easily distracted by later chapters whenever reading a book plus language barrier so I never properly did most of the chapters of hrk) but ok I'll lock in before 2026 even hits. It's 6AM now.</p>
