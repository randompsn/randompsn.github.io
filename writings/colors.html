        <h1>The Only Correct Opinion On School Subjects's Colors</h1>
            <p>This was originally in random.html, but my opinions form such long paragraphs so here we are. Recycled from my long comment in mitadmissions.org/blogs (I felt like I've bet everything I've learnt during middle school english classes here).</p>
            <p>[...]First, Math is definitely Blue,[...]I disagree how Jack treated math as “rigid” while linking blue with fluidity to back up his argument, for that treating clarity in form as rigidity is completely ignorant to the subject's inner character. There are manifolds, topological spaces, fractals, all sorts of “variety” in Math, and treating Math as rigid because of the strictness of proofs is like saying “Every function of time is non-changing because we can take the time derivative of its form”. Besides, “Math is brutal” is a common mindset, but I'd argue that most of that mindset consists of pop-culture's distortion and the lack of appreciation of the beautiness of its essentiality, and once one abandoned their fear everyone will be able to see how reassuring, illuminating and amazing Math is. Also, Math is so vast that one can find it almost everywhere in other subjects, just like how the ocean occupies most of our earth's volume, surface area and species of lifeform, and therefore Math must be blue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, science is cyan. I agree with Aiden that Jack weighted too much on the natural properties of colors and the personal interpretations of colors and “vibes” are heavily underrepresented, but I'd also like to address some facts here, that treating RBY instead of RGB as the 3 basic colors is very ignorant of scientific natural properties of colors——The RGB combination is the 3 optical basic colors, which are the colors one'll find on a “white screen” (if they look very close), and the colors that human eyes are the most sensitive to. This immediately invalidated Jack's argument that “because it's a fundamental subject, Science is Yellow” instead of green, for that the color yellow is merely a mixture of red and green viewed from the more fundamental combination of RGB. <br> Green is good, but the reason I decided science to be cyan instead of green is for its deep connection with Mathematics (see also: Physics) so it's tilted a bit to the blue side from green (where I used the fact that Math is blue), and a lot in my homeland give green exclusively to biology. Also, cyan (sai-en) rhymes extremely well with Science (sai-ens).</p>
            <p>I also agree that Social Studies is so boring that I don't want to go over it AGHH</p>
            <p>(Generally I'd assign cool-toned colors to STEM and warm-toned colors to Liberal Arts. The former is cool in a reassuring and sobering way, while the latter is warm and stimulates more conflicts like how molecules collide more frequently when heated)</p>
            <p>Also, Chemistry is Laser White (aka rainbow white). This should be widely recognized for its white keynote and its most wide-spreaded spectrum of colors among all studies. In Chemistry labs, people are generally required to wear white lab coats and transparent goggles, which immediately builds up Chemistry's overall tone of being white. Then, most of the equipment consists of transparent bodies, while a small portion of which have colorful subparts (droppers, litmus paper, nitrate gloves etc.), and the chemical reactions are usually very colorful, which further aligns Chemistry with the characteristics of laser white. To explain this, “when white light passes through diffraction gratings, a rainbow is formed”, in which the transparent part of the equipment matches the "diffraction grating”, while the remaining colorful body & chemical reactions match the “rainbow”. In conclusion, Chemistry being best represented by Laser White is just such a fundamental fact given the colors of chemistry lab equipment and the broad range of color in chemical reactions.
